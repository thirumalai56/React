# React Router Demo

Simple dashboard page to show off React Router. This is the repository to go along with the _Learning React Router_ series on [Scotch.io](https://scotch.io).

## Getting Started

To get started, download the repo, install the dependencies, and run the production server.

```
git clone https://github.com/scotch-io/react-router-course.git
cd react-router-demo
yarn
NODE_ENV=production yarn start
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application.

If you want to view the finished application, you will need to checkout the `finished` branch, install dependencies again, and then run the project.

```
git checkout finished
yarn
NODE_ENV=production yarn start
```

Again, open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` to see the finished application.

## Development

If you want to run the project in development mode to hack along with the videos, just run `yarn dev`.
