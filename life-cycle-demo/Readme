If we have <React.StrictMode> we will see the console.log in the constructor
 and render twice.
<React.StrictMode>


Strict Mode
1. StrictMode is a tool for highlighting potential problems in an application.
2. Does not render any UI.
3. It activates additional checks and warnings for the components.
4. Strict Mode checks are run in Development mode only, 
   they do not impact the production build.
5. Use ful in detecting the deprecated features in React.
   a) Identifying the unsafe lifecycle methods.
      certain legacy lifecycle methods are unsafe for use in async React applications.
   b) Warning about deprecated findDOMNode usage
   c) Detecting legacy context API



Note : This only applies to development mode. 
Lifecycles will not be double-invoked in production mode.
